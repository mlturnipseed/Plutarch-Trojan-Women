## Introduction

This is an introduction to Plutarch's essay on the Trojan Women in his collection of essays known as *On the Excellence of Women*.

[^babbitt]  A transcription of Babbitt's translation was published online as HTML in the early 21st century by Bill Thayer.  [^thayer] I am choosing to publish my digital edition under an open license, with documentation.

## The Trojan Women

In order to understand Plutarch’s account of the Trojan women, at least some knowledge of the history of the Trojan War is necessary.  The Trojan War was fought between the Greeks and the people of Troy after Helen, the wife of Menelaus of Sparta was abducted by Prince Paris of Troy.  According to the mythology, the war lasted for about 10 years and consisted of many battles and deaths, including those of many important characters in ancient Greek history, such as Prince Hector of Troy and Achilles.  The war finally came to end when the Greek armies left a giant wooden horse outside the gates of Troy and appeared to retreat.  The Trojan army brought the horse into their city without knowing that the Greek army was hiding inside of the horse.  That night, Odysseus lead the Greek army out of the horse and into the city to conquer Troy from within. [^history.com]  Following the war, the Greeks had a long and adventurous journey home, which is documented in the *Odyssey*.

It is important to keep in mind that the ancient Greek stories told about the Trojan War are not meant to be complete reality.  These epics instead serve as one of the greatest insights into the warfare, religion, customs, and attitudes of the ancient Greeks. [^cartwright] They tell us about who the ancient Greeks were, and explain many customs and beliefs and how they came into existence.  This particular piece tells the story of the women of Troy following their defeat.  Their city had been taken over by the Greek armies, and many of them had been left without husbands.  Those who were still alive were preparing to be taken as slaves by the Greeks. [^gould]

In his account of the Trojan Women, Plutarch discusses the importance of the Trojan Women in history.  After being forced to flee Troy after the war, a tremendous storm occurred, and the trojan ships wrecked upon the shores of Italy near the Tiber River. The men fled from the ships and spread out to scour the island in search of food and any signs of people.  While the men were off wandering, the women came together and decided that they must all remain together if they want to have any hope of rebuilding a new civilization for themselves.  They had realized as Plutarch states, “that for a happy and successful people any sort of a settled habitation on land is better than all wandering and voyaging.”  

<<<<<<< HEAD
The women decided to call all of the men back together and with the lead of Roma, the Trojan women began burning all of the wrecked ships.  When the men saw the flames, they came running back to the sight of the crash, just as the women had predicted that they would.  Naturally, when the men returned they were quite angry and distraught at the sight of their burning ships.  Because the women were afraid of the men’s anger, they rushed to greet them, embracing them and kissing them kindly on the cheeks.  The men’s anger ultimately subsided because they realized that they could not control the situation.  Through the women’s kindness, the men were also able to recognize how warmly they had been received and welcomed by the local people.  The men had accepted their fate and began to settle there among the Latin people.  Because of the Trojan women’s success, it still remains a part of the tradition of the Roman women to greet others with a kiss on both cheeks.

## Conclusion

Although the women only embraced and kissed the men out of fear and instinct, they were quite clever in doing so.  Their kisses were successful none the less, because they were able to almost immediately end the men's anger and achieve their goal of beginning to create a new society.  The Trojan women demonstrated both bravery and intelligence, and through the telling of their story, we receive an explanation for a certain aspect of their culture, that is still relevant today.
