# Notes

1. In the "Plutarch" section, perhaps start with something like, "The *Oxford Classical Dictionary* provides some basic biographical information about Plutarch."

1. The "Trojan Women"/trilogy part. Either remove it, or mention that "The Trojan Women" is the name of a famous play by Euripides, and is not to be confused with Plutarch's essay "On the Excellence of the Trojan Women".

1. I want to read Plutarch's bit about "and this is why Italians greet each other". Maybe follow P's essay and divide the end of the story into two parts: (1) …and this is why Italians…, (2) "the reason the womens' kisses worked…"

1. Replace "Wikipedia" entry with something from http://classics.oxfordre.com/abstract/10.1093/acrefore/9780199381135.001.0001/acrefore-9780199381135-e-2565?rskey=Zoxsky&result=5 .
